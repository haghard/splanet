# Note! You don't have to have repos.txt on your classpath but we've added this one as an example
# for those cases where you want to override the default one that is inside the vertx-platform.jar
# e.g. perhaps you have your own Maven repository you want to use

# Local Maven repo on filesystem
mavenLocal:/Volumes/Data/dev_build_tools/apache-maven-3.1.1/repository
#~/.m2/repository

# Maven central
#maven:http://repo2.maven.org/maven2

# Sonatype snapshots
#maven:http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots

# Bintray
